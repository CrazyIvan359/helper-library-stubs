# openHAB Python Stubs

This repository contains Python stub (`.pyi`) files for the openHAB core packages to provide type hints when writing scripts and modules in Jython.


## Documentation

* [Installation](Install.md)
* [Usage](Usage.md)
* [Actions](Actions.md)
* [Reference](Reference.md)

The documentation provides examples and imports for openHAB 3.x only at this time.
If you are using openHAB 2.x you will find most imports simply need to be changed from `org.openhab` to `org.eclipse.smarthome`.
